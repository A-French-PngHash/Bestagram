# Bestagram

This is a big project that I'm starting. It will consist of recreating a working copy of the well known Instagram app from Facebook. It will goes from the front end which will be in a first time, a swift application for Ios to the back end, written in python. The database will be a MySQL Database.
It is an educationnal purpose project which mean it is not to be used in any other way than this.

You can find the **Roadmap** on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/oTma0uAS)

## Style
This section will describe the syntaxic style used in the different languages.
### Swift
The style to use when coding in swift is the default style of swiftlint. No code should be pushed if it doesn't respect swiftlint style code. Disabling rules may happen in exceptionnal situations only when there is absolutely no way to do differently.

## API
You can find the API documentation in "Back End/api/Api Documentation.md".

## Database
You can find the database documentation in "Back End/database/Database Documentation.md".

## Differences from the original Instagram app

There is a few differences from the original Instagram app that I will explain here.

There will be **no Explore tab**, as I want to make this copy more friends for friends. Moreover, to give an Explore tab, Facebook uses very complex machine learning which would take years to implement.

## Notes
 
While creating the app I'm trying to use as much SF Symbol as possible in order to limit the number of assets to import.
